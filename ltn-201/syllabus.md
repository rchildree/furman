## Overview
Reading and interpretation of writings by classical Latin authors. New vocabulary, review of basic grammar and introduction to new grammar, guidance in translation and comprehension of moderately difficult Latin.

## Purpose, method, goals
The purpose of this course is to increase your ability to read Latin quickly and with understanding. We will attack this target by two methods:  
1. Extensive reading of Latin texts: our goal is quantity, to see a lot of Latin (and more importantly to re-see grammatical structures and vocabulary until they become very familiar)
2. Focused analyses of specific parts of the text: our goal is quality of explication, to be extremely precise about how the language is constructing meaning and according to what rules.

We will begin with one of the most widely-read books of late antiquity a (?)romance titled [*Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri*](https://www.inusum.com/historia-apollonii-regis-tyri). Near the end of the semester, we will switch to another text that was more popular than its current reputation allows, the [*Ilias Latina*](https://www.inusum.com/ilias-latina).

These tactics should help us achieve these goals:
1. Get practice and experience reading extended Latin texts
2. Review and solidify understanding of Latin syntax
3. Accurately analyze and discuss features of Latin grammar and syntax

## Expectations and evaluation
You should give your best effort to reading the Latin texts assigned for each day, *but not be afraid* to note parts that confuse you and ask questions about them. You should make full use of the [resources online](resources.html) to complete your grammatical analyses.

The course grade will be determined from:

| Assignment | Percentage |
|:-------------|------------------:|
| Preparation and analyses | 40% |
| Part 1 test: *Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri* | 30% |
| Part 2 test: *Ilias Latina* | 30% |

## Course policies
**Attendance** &nbsp; &nbsp;Our course depends on contributions from everyone: when any one person is absent, the richness of our conversation is lessened. Likewise, it is impossible to retell or recreate the full thread of a class’s discussion. A great deal of what is important in this class will come from our shared class time; our interaction is vital to full understanding, and so it is also vital to your success. In short: be in class unless a legitimate concern prevents you from doing so.

**Makeups** &nbsp; &nbsp;When it comes to making-up missed assignments, I am understanding but not indulgent. Be in contact with me as early as you can. You should expect to make up work you have missed immediately upon returning to class unless there are extenuating circumstances. In any case, finding out what you’ve missed and arranging to make it up is your responsibility.

**Academic integrity** &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not expect problems with cheating: you all know better. If there is a problem, the consequences will be appropriately severe. To quote from Furman’s policies: “All forms of academic misconduct including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and unacceptable collaboration are violations of Furman’s academic integrity standard.” For more information, talk to me or visit furman.edu/integrity.

**Accessibility** &nbsp; &nbsp;Any student who needs academic accommodations should be in contact with Accessibility Resources ([SOAR](https://www.furman.edu/accessibility/current-student-resources/)). After meeting with them, contact me during office hours or at class so we can make arrangements.

## Communication
My contact information appears at the top of this syllabus along with my office hours. Office hours are not for crises only — you can and should talk to me for lots of different reasons. I am here to help you. And if office hours aren’t available for you because of a scheduling conflict, we can schedule a specific time. Here is a non-exhaustive list of reasons for us to talk:
- When you miss class, in order to find out what you missed or changes to assignments.
- When you know beforehand that you will miss a class, so I can know too.
- When you feel confused or unsure — or confident and accomplished.
- When you would like to find out how you’re doing in the class.
- When I might be able to offer help or advice with just about anything.
