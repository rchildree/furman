## Overview
Introduction to the fundamentals of ancient Greek. Topics include: pronunciation, basic vocabulary, grammar and syntax, practice in reading. Material is adapted from classical texts and cultivates an appreciation of Greek literature and culture.

## Purpose, method, goals
This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of Greek vocabulary, wordforms, and syntax. Combined with GRK 120, it introduces the student to all the Greek necessary to begin reading authentic ancient Greek texts like Homer’s _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_, Herodotus’s _Histories_, Greek Tragedy, Plato, and more.

Each day in class is spent incrementally adding a new grammatical/syntactical topic or reviewing topics already learned. Each ‘Lesson’ in the textbook makes up the content of approximately a day’s work, though often we will combine Lessons.

Our goals in this course:
1. Thoroughly internalize the Greek alphabet and its sounds
1. Learn and recognize the most common forms of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.
1. Build a basic vocabulary of the most frequently occurring words
1. Begin to gain the reading skills necessary to read an inflected language

## Expectations and evaluation
In class, we’ll work our way through each day’s new grammar and practice with simple exercises. You will be responsible for learning the small list of new words that comes with each Lesson. When we are all together, you should definitely ask whatever questions occur to you — there is no other way to improve! 

The course grade will be determined from:

| Assignment | Percentage |
|:-------------|------------------:|
| Homework and preparation | 40%
| Test after Lesson 15 | 10%
| Test after Lesson 21 | 10%
| Test after Lesson 25 | 10%
| Test after Lesson 30 | 10%
| Final after Lesson 44 | 20%

## Course policies
**Attendance**{: .text-purple-200} &nbsp; &nbsp;Our course depends on contributions from everyone: when any one person is absent, the richness of our conversation is lessened. Likewise, it is impossible to retell or recreate the full thread of a class’s discussion. A great deal of what is important in this class will come from our shared class time; our interaction is vital to full understanding, and so it is also vital to your success. In short: be in class unless a legitimate concern prevents you from doing so.

**Makeups**{: .text-purple-200} &nbsp; &nbsp;When it comes to making-up missed assignments, I am understanding but not indulgent. Be in contact with me as early as you can. You should expect to make up work you have missed immediately upon returning to class unless there are extenuating circumstances. In any case, finding out what you’ve missed and arranging to make it up is your responsibility.

**Academic integrity**{: .text-purple-200} &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not expect problems with cheating: you all know better. If there is a problem, the consequences will be appropriately severe. To quote from Furman’s policies: “All forms of academic misconduct including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and unacceptable collaboration are violations of Furman’s academic integrity standard.” For more information, talk to me or visit furman.edu/integrity.

**Accessibility**{: .text-purple-200} &nbsp; &nbsp;Any student who needs academic accommodations should be in contact with Accessibility Resources ([SOAR](https://www.furman.edu/accessibility/current-student-resources/)). After meeting with them, contact me during office hours or at class so we can make arrangements.

## Communication
My contact information appears at the top of this syllabus along with my office hours. Office hours are not for crises only — you can and should talk to me for lots of different reasons. I am here to help you. And if office hours aren’t available for you because of a scheduling conflict, we can schedule a specific time. Here is a non-exhaustive list of reasons for us to talk:
- When you miss class, in order to find out what you missed or changes to assignments.
- When you know beforehand that you will miss a class, so I can know too.
- When you feel confused or unsure — or confident and accomplished.
- When you would like to find out how you’re doing in the class.
- When I might be able to offer help or advice with just about anything.
